                <p>Manthan takes pride in encouraging and inspiring children to read from a very young age. It is our strong belief that reading enhances one's life both, academically and socially. As a school, we strive to make each student develop the zeal to read and enjoy different literary works. Our philosophy towards reading can be summarized in a wonderful quote by Frank Serafini -<b> “There is no such thing as a child who hates to read; there are only children who have not found the right book.”</b></p>

Children are exposed to varied kinds of music, and dance forms, and encouraged to formulate pieces of music and choreograph steps on their own. Children in the younger grades have Dance and Western Music classes incorporated into their daily schedules, allowing them to unwind and express themselves in the most creative way possible! During assemblies, festival celebrations, or the grand annual day event, children get to showcase their skills through melodious musical performances, and dances to peppy tracks.</p>

Captains and Vice Captains for each of the 4 houses - Agni, Amber, Prithvi and Vayu - are elected at the beginning of the academic year. These 8 captains, in turn, elect the 2 school captains though a single transferable voting system. These elections are fiercely contested with posters, speeches, nominations, withdrawals, ballots etc. akin to political elections. Students in the highest grade play the role of the election commission and ensure that the process is fair and smooth.</p>
